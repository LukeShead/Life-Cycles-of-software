# Life-Cycles-of-software
This is a short document where I explain types of Life Cycles within software 

There are many types of cycles for software development, all of these are there to help the user when designing software, 




### The first, is the Waterfall cycle(Sequential):

The waterfall cycle is a sequential cycle the process of planning and designing a project one part at a time, each stage of the project is looked at individually and only when the other stage before it has been fully completed, this can have it's advantages and disadvantages however it can be a very usefull way to plan projects when done correctly.

The Waterfall cycle helps people when trying to scedule and plan a project, they can use the cycle to have a better approach towards designing the project. With this it means that the different phases can be looked at individually, using the waterfall cycle a project can become much simpler for people to use, as well as this they will need to be able to look at all the different stages deliverables. What this means is that the waterfall cycle can allow the team to work on one task at a time, this means that when looking for errors, the debugging process will become much easier as they can look at the individual parts of code.

### The second is the V-Model(Sequential):

The V-Model is not neccessarily it's own model, it can be seen as a follow up of the waterfall cycle, despite this it has it's own ways of doing things that it can be seen as it's own model. The V-Model is completely reliant on the testing phase of each stage of the project, like the waterfall, it does not move to the next stage until the stage it is currently on is fully tested and completed. Where the V-Model is different is that the model does not work from the top down, but rather the bottom up, how this is done is that all of the simple problems are solved first, the problems will get more complex the further up the project goes, once a problem that is too complex appears, the model is worked back down testing each element of the stage. On one side of the model is the validation testing and another is the verification testing, these are both followed when testing the issues that occur.

V-Model is a useful model to use when trying newer and smaller projects, this is because the model is very simple in it's completion and is quite easy to understand. Because of this many companies will use it when needing it for a small project that is already fully planned. As well as this the model is very controlled, as it goes through phases one by one with testing in between, it means that it is very thorough in how it operates, this means that the quality of the project stages can be controlled and increased through these means.

However, despite the pros of the V-Model being very useful for certain situations, there can be some cons to this system as well when comparing it to other situations, for example where the V-Model is useful for shorter projects, it is very poor and managing a longer and potentially ever-updating project, as the model requires the projects to be built from the down up, it means that if the project has any changes, they can affect how the project is developed, this could mean changing the foundation of the projects functions, having built it from the bottom up, in order to update it the developing team may have to restart the project completely. 



### The third is the Evolutionary/Prototyping cycle(Iterative):

This is also called evolutionary prototyping, it is the process of creating multiple prototypes with each increasing in quality, this is done until the final product is completed, where as this may be perfect for when dealing with a client, as the client can look at each individual step of the project and can have a say in each process, however when looking at the current point of each prototype, it means that it can take up a very long time to keep creating prototypes and having them renewed. When looking at the Pros and Cons of this method, the pros are about the quality insurance, this means that the product will have exactly what the client or team want, however the cons are this means that much more work must be put into each point.

### The fourth is the Spiral Model(Iterative):

The Spiral Model is a blend of the Prototyping and Waterfall models, it combines elements from each one in order to make a new model that focuses on constant testing as well as keeping each part separate from the other, this is done by major companies as it can take up a lot of time and money to execute however much better quality is ensured this way. This entire model has pros and cons of the first two put together it is a very safe but quite expensive in money and time.

### How Risks are managed with the spiral model:

A spiral Model can be very effective, one reason for this is because of how the risks are managed in the spiral model. The 3rd step within the steps of the spiral model is to analyse any risks and resolve them before continuing. By doing this method it ensures that all potential risks that could appear will be dealt with before they can hinder the project. This method is used with every step that is used with the spiral model, because of this the risks of the project can be managed very well due to this tactic.

During the analytical stage of the model, the most amount of caution must be used, this is because when managing the risk within the spiral model, the risks that are identified will come from this stage. The spiral most is called a 'Risk-Driven Model', this is because it functions by identifying risks and preventing them as the project is completed. This means that in order to manage risks, they first need to be identified, this is where this stage is used the most.

When working as a team, the testing team and the developing team will work together by working in unison, for example once one part of the project has been developed, the testing team will begin testing it before the next part of the project is developed, this means that the development team must be have good communication methods of keeping the testing team updated in order to keep good progress on the project and stay on the scheduled time.

When analysing different risks of a project with the spiral model, there is a special requirement of skills that are needed and there are specific expertise in order to successfuly analyse risks. The risks that can be discovered have a very wide area that they can cover from very minor and trivial risks to risks that could be potentially fatal to the project, because of this the risks must be put into an order of priority that can be looked back onto in order to see what risks are worse than others and as of such, what risks to deal with first. Whenever this stage is completed, the next step is to make a prototype of the project in order to mark down how the analysis went.

### The fifth model is the RAD(Iterative):

RAD or otherwise known as the Rapid Application Development model is where the team will use prototyping instead of planning, this means that there is almost no planning that will go into the development it will only go into prototyping and building. This can be very useful for a project that has a short deadline, as well as this it means that changes can be made throughout the production. However, what this means is that the project can be flexible, however what this also means is that sometimes for a project to be completed they must be done properly, and the team that are designing it must all be experienced in order to make it faster for the project to be completed, also if there are any issues with communication it can highly impact the project.


### Traditional and agile:

Traditional models are models like the waterfall model where everything is planned from the start, this includes the different steps that the process will need to follow and the development process. These models are used for more important projects that have a timeframe that is reasonable to have time to do this planning. Agile is the opposite to this as it is where the team will be prototyping constantly with regular feedback, this is where the RAD comes into.
