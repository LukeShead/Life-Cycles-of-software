# Life-Cycles-of-software
This is a short document where I explain types of Life Cycles within software 

There are many types of cycles for software development, all of these are there to help the user when designing software, 




### The first, is the Waterfall cycle:

The waterfall cycle is the process of planning and designing a project one part at a time, each stage of the project is looked at individually and only when the other stage before it has been fully completed, this can have it's advantages and disadvantages however it can be a very usefull way to plan projects when done correctly.

The Waterfall cycle helps people when trying to scedule and plan a project, they can use the cycle to have a better approach towards designing the project. With this it means that the different phases can be looked at individually, using the waterfall cycle a project can become much simpler for people to use, as well as this they will need to be able to look at all the different stages deliverables. What this means is that the waterfall cycle can allow the team to work on one task at a time, this means that when looking for errors, the debugging process will become much easier as they can look at the individual parts of code.

### The second is the Evolutionary/Prototyping cycle:

This is also called evolutionary prototyping, it is the process of creating multiple prototypes with each increasing in quality, this is done until the final product is completed, where as this may be perfect for when dealing with a client, as the client can look at each individual step of the project and can have a say in each process, however when looking at the current point of each prototype, it means that it can take up a very long time to keep creating prototypes and having them renewed. When looking at the Pros and Cons of this method, the pros are about the quality insurance, this means that the product will have exactly what the client or team want, however the cons are this means that much more work must be put into each point.

### Third up is the Spiral Model:

The Spiral Model is the child of the Prototyping and Waterfall models, it combines elements from each one in order to make a new model that focuses on constant testing as well as keeping each part separate from the other, this is done by major companies as it can take up a lot of time and money to execute however much better quality is ensured this way. This entire model has pros and cons of the first two put together it is a very safe but quite expensive in money and time. A spiral Model can be very effective, one reason for this is because of how the risks are managed in the spiral model. As there are steps at every point, the 3rd is to analyse any risks and resolve them before continuing. By doing this method it ensures that all potential risks that could appear will be dealt with before they can become a problem. This method is used with everystep that is used with the spiral model, because of this the risks of the project can be managed very well due to this tactic.


### The fourth model is the RAD:

RAD or otherwise known as the Rapid Application Development model is where the team will use prototyping instead of planning, this means that there is almost no planning that will go into the development it will only go into prototyping and building. This can be very useful for a project that has a short deadline, as well as this it means that changes can be made throughout the production. However, what this means is that the project can be flexible, however what this also means is that sometimes for a project to be completed they must be done properly, and the team that are designing it must all be experienced in order to make it faster for the project to be completed, also if there are any issues with communication it can highly impact the project.

### Traditional and agile:

Traditional models are models like the waterfall model where everything is planned from the start, this includes the different steps that the process will need to follow and the development process. These models are used for more important projects that have a timeframe that is reasonable to have time to do this planning. Agile is the opposite to this as it is where the team will be prototyping constantly with regular feedback, this is where the RAD comes into.
