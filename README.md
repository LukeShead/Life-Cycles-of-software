# Life-Cycles-of-software
This is a short document where I explain types of Life Cycles within software 

There are many types of cycles for software development, all of these are there to help the user when designing software, 




### The first, is the Waterfall cycle, the advantages to the cycle are:

-Easy to explain to the users.

-Structures approach.

-Stages and activities are well defined.

-Helps to plan and schedule the project.

-Verification at each stage ensures early detection of errors/misunderstanding.

-Each phase has specific deliverables.


### The disadvantages are:

-Assumes that the requirements of a system can be frozen.

-Very difficult to go back to any stage after it finished.

-A little flexibility and adjusting scope is difficult and expensive.

-Costly and required more time, in addition to the detailed plan.
